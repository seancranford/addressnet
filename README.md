# addressnet
<b> Testing different solutions to the addressnet problem statement </b> <br>
<b> Reference: </b> This projects builds on the original work completed in the addressnet repo for Australia addresses <br>
The project goals include: <br>
1. Build RNN solution for Australia addresses using numpy/scipy packages only <br>
2. Build LSTM solution for Australia addresses using numpy/scipy packages only <br>
3. Build RNN and LSTM solutions using Keras/Tensorflow <br>
4. Compare performance results when controlling for randomness and hyperparameters <br>
5. Extend the use case to Irish addresses using AnPost dataset <br>
